Topic pattern is similar to routing pattern but use BuiltinExchangeType.TOPIC to indicate the exchange.

In topic pattern, queue use wildcard to match some classes message.

In this case, '#' match one or more word and '*' match only one.

eg: china.# match china.news, china.sports, china.sweater...
